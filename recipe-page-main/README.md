## Overview

### The challenge
The task involved creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface (UI) using HTML and CSS on every devices's screen size. The main challenge was to design an interface that not only presented static elements but also dynamically populated results. This required structuring the HTML for efficient content display and utilizing CSS to ensure a user-friendly layout and design.
