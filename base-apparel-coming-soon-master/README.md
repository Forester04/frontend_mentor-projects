Your challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

    Select and submit a number rating
    See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
